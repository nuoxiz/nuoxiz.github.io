          Dongguan (/dʊŋˈɡwæn/;[3] Chinese: 东莞市) is a prefecture-level city
          in central Guangdong Province, China. An important industrial city in
          the Pearl River Delta, Dongguan borders the provincial capital of
          Guangzhou to the north, Huizhou to the northeast, Shenzhen to the
          south, and the Pearl River to the west. It is part of the Pearl River
          Delta built-up (or metro) area with more than 65.57 million
          inhabitants as of the 2020 census spread over nine municipalities
          across an area of 19,870 square kilometres (7,670 sq mi).[1]
          Dongguan's city administration is considered especially progressive in
          seeking foreign direct investment.[4][who?] Dongguan ranks behind only
          Shenzhen, Shanghai and Suzhou in exports among Chinese cities, with
          $65.54 billion in shipments. It is also home to one of the world's
          largest shopping malls, the New South China Mall,[5] which is seeing
          increased activity.[6] Although the city is geographically and thus
          culturally Cantonese in the Weitou form and as well as culturally
          Hakka in the prefectures of Fenggang and Qingxi, the majority of the
          modern-day population speaks Mandarin due to the large influx of
          economic migrants from other parts of China.[7] The city is home to
          several universities, including Guangdong University of Science and
          Technology, Guangdong Medical University and Dongguan University of
          Technology.
