          Wuhan (/wuːˈhæn/, US also /wuːˈhɑːn, ˈwuː-/;[14] simplified Chinese:
          武汉; traditional Chinese: 武漢; pinyin: Wǔhàn; [ù.xân] (listen)) is
          the capital of Hubei Province in the People's Republic of China.[15]
          It is the largest city in Hubei and the most populous city in Central
          China,[16] with a population of over eleven million, the ninth-most
          populous Chinese city and one of the nine National Central Cities of
          China.[17] The name "Wuhan" came from the city's historical origin
          from the conglomeration of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, which are
          collectively known as the "Three Towns of Wuhan" (武汉三镇). Wuhan
          lies in the eastern Jianghan Plain, at the confluence of the Yangtze
          river and its largest tributary, the Han River, and is known as "Nine
          Provinces' Thoroughfare" (九省通衢).[1] Wuhan has historically served
          as a busy city port for commerce and trading. Other historical events
          taking place in Wuhan include the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, which led
          to the end of 2,000 years of dynastic rule. Wuhan was briefly the
          capital of China in 1927 under the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT)
          government.[18] The city later served as the wartime capital of China
          for ten months in 1937 during the WWII.[19][20] Wuhan is considered
          the political, economic, financial, commercial, cultural, and
          educational center of Central China.[16] It is a major transportation
          hub, with dozens of railways, roads, and expressways passing through
          the city and connecting to other major cities.[21] Because of its key
          role in domestic transportation, Wuhan is sometimes referred to as
          "the Chicago of China" by foreign sources.[3][4][5] The "Golden
          Waterway" of the Yangtze River and the Han River traverse the urban
          area and divide Wuhan into the three districts of Wuchang, Hankou, and
          Hanyang. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge crosses the Yangtze in the
          city. The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station in terms
          of installed capacity, is located nearby. Historically, Wuhan has
          suffered risks of flooding,[22] prompting the government to alleviate
          the situation by introducing ecologically friendly absorption
          mechanisms.[23] While Wuhan has been a traditional manufacturing hub
          for decades, it is also one of the areas promoting modern industrial
          changes in China. Wuhan has three national development zones, four
          scientific and technological development parks, over 350 research
          institutes, 1,656 high tech enterprises, numerous enterprise
          incubators and investments from 230 Fortune Global 500 firms.[24] It
          produced GDP (nominal) of US$274 billion in 2021. The Dongfeng Motor
          Corporation, an automobile manufacturer, is headquartered in Wuhan.
          The city is home to multiple notable institutes of higher education,
          including Wuhan University[25] and the Huazhong University of Science
          and Technology. Wuhan is a major city in the world by scientific
          research outputs and it ranks 14th globally and 5th in China (after
          Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Guangzhou).[26] In 2017, Wuhan was
          designated as a Creative City by UNESCO, in the field of design.[27]
          Wuhan is classified as a Beta- (global second tier) city together with
          seven other cities in China, including Changsha, Dalian, Jinan,
          Shenyang, Xiamen, Xi'an and Zhengzhou by the Globalization and World
          Cities Research Network.[28] Wuhan is also one of the world's top 100
          financial centers, according to the Global Financial Centres
          Index.[29]
