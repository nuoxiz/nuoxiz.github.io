        Guangzhou (UK: /ɡwæŋˈdʒoʊ/,[5] US: /ɡwɒŋ-/;[6] simplified Chinese: 广州;
        traditional Chinese: 廣州; pinyin: Guǎngzhōu; Cantonese pronunciation:
        [kʷɔ̌ːŋ.tsɐ̂u] or [kʷɔ̌ːŋ.tsɐ́u] (listen); Mandarin pronunciation: [kwàŋ
        tʂóu] (listen)), also known as Canton /kænˈtɒn/[7] and alternatively
        romanized as Kwongchow or Kwangchow,[8] is the capital and the largest
        city of Guangdong province in southern China.[9] Located on the Pearl
        River about 120 km (75 mi) north-northwest of Hong Kong and 145 km (90
        mi) north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was
        a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road,[10] and continues to serve
        as a major port and transportation hub, as well as one of China's three
        largest cities.[11] For a long time the only Chinese port accessible to
        most foreign traders, Guangzhou was captured by the British during the
        First Opium War. No longer enjoying a monopoly after the war, it lost
        trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to
        serve as a major transshipment port. Due to a high urban population and
        large volumes of port traffic, Guangzhou is classified as a Large-Port
        Megacity, the largest type of port-city in the world.[12] Due to
        worldwide pandemic-related restrictions on traveling in 2020, Guangzhou
        Baiyun International Airport, the major airport of Guangzhou, became the
        world's busiest airport by passenger traffic.[13] Guangzhou is at the
        heart of the most-populous built-up metropolitan area in the world,
        which extends into the neighboring cities of Foshan, Dongguan,
        Zhongshan, Shenzhen and part of Jiangmen, Huizhou, Zhuhai and Macao,
        forming the largest urban agglomeration on Earth with approximately
        65,594,622 residents[14] and part of the Pearl River Delta Economic
        Zone. Administratively, the city holds subprovincial status[15] and is
        one of China's nine National Central Cities.[16] In the late 1990s and
        early 2000s, nationals of sub-Saharan Africa who had initially settled
        in the Middle East and Southeast Asia moved in unprecedented numbers to
        Guangzhou in response to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis.[17] The
        domestic migrant population from other provinces of China in Guangzhou
        was 40% of the city's total population in 2008. Together with Shanghai,
        Beijing and Shenzhen, Guangzhou has one of the most expensive real
        estate markets in China.[18] As of the 2020 census, the registered
        population of the city's expansive administrative area was 18,676,605
        individuals (up to 47% from the previous census in 2010) whom 16,492,590
        lived in 9 urban districts (all but Conghua and Zengcheng).[2] In modern
        commerce, Guangzhou is best known for its annual Canton Fair, the oldest
        and largest trade fair in China. For three consecutive years
        (2013–2015), Forbes ranked Guangzhou as the best commercial city in
        mainland China.[19] Guangzhou is highly ranked as an Alpha- (global
        first-tier) city together with San Francisco and Stockholm. It is a
        leading financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region and ranks 21st
        globally in the 2020 Global Financial Centres Index.[20] As an important
        international city, Guangzhou has hosted numerous international and
        national sporting events, the most notable being the 2010 Asian Games,
        the 2010 Asian Para Games, and the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. The
        city hosts 65 foreign representatives, making it the third major city to
        host more foreign representatives than any other cities in China after
        Beijing and Shanghai.[21][22] As of 2020, Guangzhou ranks 10th in the
        world and 5th in China (after Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen)
        for the number of billionaire residents by the Hurun Global Rich
        List.[23]
