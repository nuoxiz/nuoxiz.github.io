            Shanghai (/ʃæŋˈhaɪ/;[17] Chinese: 上海, Shanghainese pronunciation
            [zɑ̃̀.hɛ́] (listen), Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [ʂâŋ.xàɪ]
            (listen)) is one of the four direct-administered municipalities of
            the People's Republic of China.[a] The city is located on the
            southern estuary of the Yangtze River, with the Huangpu River
            flowing through it. With a population of 24.89 million as of 2021,
            Shanghai is the most populous urban area in China and the most
            populous city proper in the world. It is the only city in East Asia
            with a GDP greater than its corresponding capital. As of 2018, the
            Greater Shanghai metropolitan area, which includes Suzhou, Wuxi,
            Nantong, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Zhoushan, and Huzhou, was estimated to
            produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 9.1
            trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion).[20] Shanghai has been one of the
            world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research,
            education, science and technology, manufacturing, tourism, culture,
            dining, art, fashion, sports, and transportation, and the Port of
            Shanghai is the world's busiest container port. In 2019, the
            Shanghai Pudong International Airport was one of the world's 10
            busiest airports by passenger traffic,[21][22] and one of the two
            international airports serving the Shanghai metropolitan area, the
            other one being the Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.
            Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in
            importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign
            trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five
            treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium
            War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession
            were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a
            primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During
            the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major
            Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the communists takeover of
            the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries
            and the city's global influence declined. By the 1990s, economic
            reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping a decade earlier resulted in an
            intense redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong New Area,
            aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has
            since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is
            the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock
            exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Shanghai
            Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. As of
            2020, Shanghai was classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city
            by the GaWC and ranked as having the 3rd most competitive and
            largest financial center in the world behind New York City and
            London by the Global Financial Centres Index.[23] It has the largest
            metro network of any city in the world, the fifth-highest number of
            billionaires of any city in the world, the fifth-largest number of
            skyscrapers of any city in the world, the fifth-largest scientific
            research output of any city in the world, and highly ranked
            educational institutions including Fudan, Shanghai Jiao Tong,
            Tongji, East China Normal, Shanghai, Donghua, Shanghai University of
            Finance and Economics, East China University of Science and
            Technology, and University of Shanghai for Science and
            Technology.[24]
