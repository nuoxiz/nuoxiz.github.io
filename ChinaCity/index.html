          Beijing (/beɪˈdʒɪŋ/ bay-JING;[9][10] Chinese: 北京; pinyin: běi jīng;
          Mandarin pronunciation: [pèɪ.tɕíŋ] (listen)), alternatively romanized
          as Peking[11] (/piːˈkɪŋ/ pee-KING),[12] is the capital of the People's
          Republic of China. It is the world's most populous national capital
          city, with over 21 million residents within an administrative area of
          16,410.5 km2 (6336 sq. mi.).[13] Nevertheless its built-up area, the
          third largest in China after Guangzhou and Shanghai, is slightly
          bigger, including 3 districts in Hebei (Sanhe, Dachang Hui and
          Zhuozhou) being conurbated but with Miyun and Pinggu Districts in
          Beijing not agglomerated yet.[14] It is located in Northern China, and
          is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the
          State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[15]
          Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of
          neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions
          form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of
          China.[16] Beijing is a global city and one of the world's leading
          centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and
          economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport,
          science and technology and transportation. A megacity, Beijing is the
          second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai and is
          the nation's cultural, educational, and political center.[17] It is
          home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned
          companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500
          companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial
          institutions by total assets.[18][19] Beijing is the "billionaire
          capital of the world" with the highest number of billionaires living
          in the city.[20][21] It is also a major hub for the national highway,
          expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital
          International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by
          passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[22] and, as of 2016,
          the city's subway network is the busiest and longest in the world. The
          Beijing Daxing International Airport, a second international airport
          in Beijing, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the
          world.[23
