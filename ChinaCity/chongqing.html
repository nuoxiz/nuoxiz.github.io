          Chongqing (/ˌtʃʊŋˈtʃɪŋ/ chawng-CHING[9] or /ˈtʃɔːŋˌtʃɪŋ/
          CHAWNG-ching;[10][11] simplified Chinese: 重庆; traditional Chinese:
          重慶; pinyin: Chóngqìng; Sichuanese pronunciation: [tsʰoŋ˨˩tɕʰin˨˩˦],
          Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [ʈʂʰʊ̌ŋ.tɕʰîŋ] (listen)), alternately
          romanized as Chungking (/ˈtʃʊŋˈkɪŋ/),[12] is a municipality in
          southwest China. Administratively, it is one of the four
          municipalities under the direct administration of the central
          government of the People's Republic of China (the other three are
          Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin), and the only such municipality
          located deep inland.[13] The municipality of Chongqing, roughly the
          size of Austria, includes the city of Chongqing as well as various
          discontiguous cities. Due to a classification technicality, Chongqing
          municipality can claim to be the largest city proper in the
          world—though it does not have the world's largest urban area.
          Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport, a major aviation hub serving
          Chongqing metropolitan areas and Western China, is one of the top 50
          busiest airports in the world,[14][15] and the city's monorails system
          is the world's longest and busiest monorails system with the greatest
          number of stations (70).[16][17] During the Republic of China (ROC)
          era, Chongqing was a municipality located within Sichuan Province. It
          served as its wartime capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War
          (1937–1945). The current municipality was separated from Sichuan
          province on 14 March 1997 to help develop the central and western
          parts of China.[18] The Chongqing administrative municipality has a
          population of over 30 million.[19] The city of Chongqing, comprising
          nine urban and suburban districts, has a population of 8,750,000 as of
          the 2018 estimation. According to the 2010 census, Chongqing is the
          most populous Chinese municipality,[20] and also the largest
          direct-controlled municipality in China, containing 26 districts,
          eight counties, and four autonomous counties. The official
          abbreviation of the city, "Yú" (渝), was approved by the State Council
          on 18 April 1997.[21] This abbreviation is derived from the old name
          of a part of the Jialing River that runs through Chongqing and feeds
          into the Yangtze River. Chongqing has an extensive history and a rich
          culture. As one of China's National Central Cities, it serves as a
          financial center of the Sichuan Basin and the upstream Yangtze. It is
          a major manufacturing and transportation center; a July 2012 report by
          the Economist Intelligence Unit described it as one of China's "13
          emerging megalopolises".[22] Chongqing is ranked as a Beta (global
          second-tier) city.[23] Chongqing is one of the top 100 cities in the
          world by scientific research outputs as tracked by the Nature
          Index,[24] and home to several notable universities, including
          Chongqing University, Southwest University, Chongqing University of
          Posts and Telecommunications, Southwest University of Political
          Science and Law, and Chongqing Normal University.
