      Shenzhen (/ˌʃɛnˈdʒɛn/;[7] /ʃɛnˈʒɛn/;[8] Chinese: 深圳; pinyin: Shēnzhèn;
      Mandarin pronunciation: [ʂə́n.ʈʂə̂n] (listen)), also historically known as
      Sham Chun,[9] is a major sub-provincial city and one of the special
      economic zones of China. The city is located on the east bank of the Pearl
      River estuary on the central coast of southern province of Guangdong,
      bordering Hong Kong to the south, Dongguan to the north, and Huizhou to
      the northeast. With a population of 17.56 million as of 2020, Shenzhen is
      the third most populous city proper in China. Shenzhen is a global center
      in technology, research, manufacturing, business and economics, finance,
      tourism and transportation, and the Port of Shenzhen is the world's fourth
      busiest container port. Shenzhen roughly follows the administrative
      boundaries of Bao'an County, which was established since imperial times.
      The southern portion of Bao'an County was seized by the British after the
      Opium Wars and became Hong Kong, while the village of Shenzhen was
      situated on the border. Due to the completion of a train station that was
      the last stop on the Mainland Chinese section of the railway between
      Guangzhou and Kowloon, Shenzhen's economy grew and became a market town
      and later a city by 1979, absorbing Bao'an County for the next decade. In
      the early 1980s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in
      the city becoming the first special economic zone of China due to its
      close proximity to Hong Kong, attracting foreign direct investment and
      migrants searching for opportunities. In thirty years, the city's economy
      and population boomed and has since emerged as a hub for technology,
      international trade, and finance. It is the home to the Shenzhen Stock
      Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market
      capitalization and the Guangdong Free-Trade Zone. As of 2020, Shenzhen is
      ranked as an Alpha- (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and
      World Cities Research Network and ranked as having the 8th most
      competitive and largest financial center in the world.[10] Its nominal GDP
      has surpassed neighboring cities of Guangzhou and Hong Kong and is now
      among the top ten cities with the largest economies in the world. Shenzhen
      also has the fifth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the
      world, the second largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the world,
      the 28th largest scientific research output of any city in the world,[11]
      and several notable educational institutions, such as Shenzhen University,
      Southern University of Science and Technology, and Shenzhen Technology
      University.
