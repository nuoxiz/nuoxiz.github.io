        Shanghai (/ʃæŋˈhaɪ/;[17] Chinese: 上海, Shanghainese pronunciation
        [zɑ̃̀.hɛ́] (listen), Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [ʂâŋ.xàɪ] (listen))
        is one of the four direct-administered municipalities of the People's
        Republic of China.[a] The city is located on the southern estuary of the
        Yangtze River, with the Huangpu River flowing through it. With a
        population of 24.89 million as of 2021, Shanghai is the most populous
        urban area in China and the most populous city proper in the world. It
        is the only city in East Asia with a GDP greater than its corresponding
        capital. As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area, which
        includes Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Ningbo, Jiaxing, Zhoushan, and Huzhou,
        was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of
        nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion).[20] Shanghai has been one of
        the world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research,
        education, science and technology, manufacturing, tourism, culture,
        dining, art, fashion, sports, and transportation, and the Port of
        Shanghai is the world's busiest container port. In 2019, the Shanghai
        Pudong International Airport was one of the world's 10 busiest airports
        by passenger traffic,[21][22] and one of the two international airports
        serving the Shanghai metropolitan area, the other one being the Shanghai
        Hongqiao International Airport. Originally a fishing village and market
        town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both
        domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was
        one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the
        First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French
        Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished,
        becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s.
        During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major
        Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the communists takeover of the
        mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the
        city's global influence declined. By the 1990s, economic reforms
        introduced by Deng Xiaoping a decade earlier resulted in an intense
        redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the
        return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged
        as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the
        Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world
        by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, the first
        free-trade zone in mainland China. As of 2020, Shanghai was classified
        as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the GaWC and ranked as having
        the 3rd most competitive and largest financial center in the world
        behind New York City and London by the Global Financial Centres
        Index.[23] It has the largest metro network of any city in the world,
        the fifth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, the
        fifth-largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the world, the
        fifth-largest scientific research output of any city in the world, and
        highly ranked educational institutions including Fudan, Shanghai Jiao
        Tong, Tongji, East China Normal, Shanghai, Donghua, Shanghai University
        of Finance and Economics, East China University of Science and
        Technology, and University of Shanghai for Science and Technology.[24]
