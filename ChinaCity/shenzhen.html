            Shenzhen (/ˌʃɛnˈdʒɛn/;[7] /ʃɛnˈʒɛn/;[8] Chinese: 深圳; pinyin:
            Shēnzhèn; Mandarin pronunciation: [ʂə́n.ʈʂə̂n] (listen)), also
            historically known as Sham Chun,[9] is a major sub-provincial city
            and one of the special economic zones of China. The city is located
            on the east bank of the Pearl River estuary on the central coast of
            southern province of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong to the south,
            Dongguan to the north, and Huizhou to the northeast. With a
            population of 17.56 million as of 2020, Shenzhen is the third most
            populous city proper in China. Shenzhen is a global center in
            technology, research, manufacturing, business and economics,
            finance, tourism and transportation, and the Port of Shenzhen is the
            world's fourth busiest container port. Shenzhen roughly follows the
            administrative boundaries of Bao'an County, which was established
            since imperial times. The southern portion of Bao'an County was
            seized by the British after the Opium Wars and became Hong Kong,
            while the village of Shenzhen was situated on the border. Due to the
            completion of a train station that was the last stop on the Mainland
            Chinese section of the railway between Guangzhou and Kowloon,
            Shenzhen's economy grew and became a market town and later a city by
            1979, absorbing Bao'an County for the next decade. In the early
            1980s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping resulted in the
            city becoming the first special economic zone of China due to its
            close proximity to Hong Kong, attracting foreign direct investment
            and migrants searching for opportunities. In thirty years, the
            city's economy and population boomed and has since emerged as a hub
            for technology, international trade, and finance. It is the home to
            the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in
            the world by market capitalization and the Guangdong Free-Trade
            Zone. As of 2020, Shenzhen is ranked as an Alpha- (global
            first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research
            Network and ranked as having the 8th most competitive and largest
            financial center in the world.[10] Its nominal GDP has surpassed
            neighboring cities of Guangzhou and Hong Kong and is now among the
            top ten cities with the largest economies in the world. Shenzhen
            also has the fifth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the
            world, the second largest number of skyscrapers of any city in the
            world, the 28th largest scientific research output of any city in
            the world,[11] and several notable educational institutions, such as
            Shenzhen University, Southern University of Science and Technology,
            and Shenzhen Technology University.
