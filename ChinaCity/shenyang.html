          Shenyang (UK: /ʃɛnˈjæŋ/, US: /ʃʌnˈjɒŋ/;[4] simplified Chinese: 沈阳;
          traditional Chinese: 瀋陽; pinyin: Shěnyáng; Mandarin pronunciation:
          [ʂə̀n.jǎŋ]), formerly known as Fengtian (Chinese: 奉天) or by its
          Manchu name Mukden, is a major Chinese sub-provincial city and the
          provincial capital of Liaoning province. Located in central-north
          Liaoning, it's the province's most populous city, with a total
          population of 9,070,093 inhabitants as of the 2020 census. Among the
          resident population of the city, the male population is 4,521,021,
          accounting for 49.85%; the female population is 4,549,072, accounting
          for 50.15%. The sex ratio of the total population (with women as 100,
          the ratio of men to women) dropped from 102.10 in the sixth national
          census in 2010 to 99.38.[5] Its built-up (or metro) area encompassing
          8 Shenyang urban districts and the 4 Fushun urban districts, was home
          to 8,192,848 inhabitants in 2020. It's also the largest city in
          Northeast China by urban population,[6] with 7.49 million people (2020
          census).[7] Shenyang is also the central city of one of the major
          megalopolises in China, the Greater Shenyang Metropolitan Area, which
          has a total population over 23 million. The city's administrative
          region includes the ten metropolitan districts of Shenyang proper, the
          county-level city of Xinmin, and two counties: Kangping and Faku. The
          Manchu people conquered Shenyang in the 17th century and briefly used
          it as the capital of Qing-dynasty China.[8] The Battle of Mukden took
          place in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War. Japan's subsequent
          victory allowed Tokyo to annex the region west of the old city and to
          increase Japanese influence on Shenyang; in September 1931 the Mukden
          Incident led the Japanese to further invade and occupy the rest of
          Northeast China, forming the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the
          Japanese surrender in 1945, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold,
          but the Communists captured it in 1948 after the Liaoshen Campaign.
          Along with its nearby cities, Shenyang is an important industrial
          center in China,[9] and serves as the transportation and commercial
          hub of China's northeast—particularly involved in links with Japan,
          Russia and Korea.[10] A center of heavy industry in China since the
          1930s, and the spearhead of the Chinese central government's Northeast
          Area Revitalization Plan,[11] the city has been diversifying its
          industry, including expanding into the service sector. Growing
          industries include software, automotive and electronics. Shenyang is
          also a major city for scientific research, appearing among the top 200
          Science Cities in the world as tracked by the Nature Index.[12] The
          city is home to several major universities, notably Northeastern
          University and Liaoning University, members of China's prestigious
          universities in the Double First Class University Plan.
